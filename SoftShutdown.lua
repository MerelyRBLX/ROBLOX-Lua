	SoftShutdown 1.2
	Author: Merely
	
	This system lets you shut down servers without losing a bunch of players.
	When game.OnClose is called, the script teleports everyone in the server
	into a reserved server.
	
	When the reserved servers start up, they wait a few seconds, and then
	send everyone back into the main place.
	
	I added wait() in a couple of places because if you don't, everyone will spawn into
	their own servers with only 1 player.
